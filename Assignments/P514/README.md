## P514 - Rails
### Joshua Beaty
### Description:

There is a city with a single train station, but the layout makes it a dead end train station. 
Each train car can be removed from an incoming train individually to be set in the dead end station or sent 
along to the outgoing line. Cars at the station cannot go back to the incoming line.

This program will take in a blocks of desired outgoing sequences and let the user know 'yes' or 'no' 
if the incoming train can be rearranged to match the desired outgoing sequences.

In between each block of output, a blank line is output

#### Example
