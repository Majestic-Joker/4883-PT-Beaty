## 11080 - Place the Guards
### Joshua Beaty
### Description:

A king has terrible guards that fight each other when they guard the same street. He can place them at street junctions and the guards will guard that junction as well as adjacent streets and junctions. The problem is to determine if he can place guards to guard the entire city without them fighting and the minimum number of guards it will take.

    the basic steps using what I know.
