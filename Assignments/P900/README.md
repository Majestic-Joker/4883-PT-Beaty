## 900 - Brick Wall Patterns
### Joshua Beaty
### Description:

If we want to build a brick wall out of the usual size of brick which has a length twice as long as its height, and if our wall is to be two units tall, we can make our wall in a number of patterns, depnding on how long we want it.

Your task is to write a program that given the length of a wall, determines how many patterns there may be for a wall of that length.

Maximum value for the wall length if 50. Program terminates with a 0.

Since the number is so small, we just use Vector of long long ints for each value to print out.

#### Example

- Input: 
    - 1
    - 2
    - 3
    - 0


- Output: 
    - 1
    - 2
    - 3
