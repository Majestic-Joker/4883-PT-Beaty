## 920 - Sunny Mountains

### Joshua Beaty

### Description:

Figure out how much horizontal right to left sun is hitting the exposed mountain peaks.
My approach is to read the data as lines with a first coordinate and second coordinate as pairs of x,y.
Creating a line will also calculate its slope intercept stuff. Then, I mask my list of lines to only include
negatively sloped lines. Then I find the line with the largest first coordinate and
mask to include only those following it.

From there, I use the slope intercept formula x=(y-b)/m to find the missing x coordinate.
m is the slope of the line.
y is the next peak's y value.
b is already calculated in the line creation step.

Then the length of the sloped line is the square root of rise squared plus run squared. AKA pythagorean theorem.
rise = high peak y - lower peak y
run = high peak x - lower peak x

Once the lengths of each slope have been established, adding them together is a simple matter.

#### Example

  - 0 500
  - 1400 100
  - 600 600
  - 2800 0
  - 400 1100
  - 1700 600
  - 1500 800
  - 2100 300
  - 1800 700
  - 2400 500
