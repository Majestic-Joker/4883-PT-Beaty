## 10035 - Primary Arithmetic

### Joshua Beaty

### Description:

Children are taught to add multi-digit numbers from right-to-left one digit at a time. Many find the
“carry” operation - in which a 1 is carried from one digit position to be added to the next - to be a
significant challenge. Your job is to count the number of carry operations for each of a set of addition
problems so that educators may assess their difficulty.

#### Example

- Input:

  - 123 456
  - 555 555
  - 123 594
  - 0 0

- Output:
  - No carry operation.
  - 3 carry operations.
  - 1 carry operation.
