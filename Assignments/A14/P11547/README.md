### Joshua Beaty

### Description:

A woman wins a contest and is required to do some mathematical steps to solve a series of questions to claim her prize. N test cases. 
For every n, multiply by 567, divide by 9, add 7492, multiply by 235, divide by 47, subtract 498 then return the number in the 10s column.
First line is the number of test cases.

each line will contain a number -1000 <= n <= 1000

The numbers are small enough that the entire program was written using regular ints.

#### Example

- Input:
  - 2
  - 637
  - -120

- Output:
  - 1
  - 3
